Main Question: Do cheap apps, in average, have a better user rating than free apps?

Sub Question: What are the genres with more reviews?

Sub Question: What is the frequency of reviews for paid Games apps?

Sub Question: What is the frequency of prices for Games apps?

Summary

Firstly, I decided to define my sample. To do that, I found the most reviewed genre - Games. Then, since there are
much more free apps than paid apps, I searched for a representative range of reviews of paid apps and 
conducted the analysis on that range - [284-3515] reviews. After defining the range of reviews, it was time to 
define the range of prices, so I did a frequency analysis on price using bins. Prices between 0 and 6 were the most
frequent and I decided to analyse that range of prices. As final result, I got the price for average rating.

Conclusion

The price with the highest average ranking(4.3750) is 3.99USD. The price with the lowest (4.1667) is 5.99 USD. Free apps 
have an average rating of 4.255. As a conclusion, apps that have a price below 3.99 are tipically more appreciated by users.
Usually, people use free apps, so when they buy an app they expect a better service, and that could be a factor on why
expensive apps have a lower user ranting - the user's expectations.
