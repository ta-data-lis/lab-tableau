# Lab | Tableau

## Introduction

Being able to understand and present the data in a straightforward way and in a short amount of time is a good skill to have at your disposal.

## Getting Started

For this lab, you will be given a [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/ramamet4/app-store-apple-data-set-10k-apps#AppleStore.csv) for which you have to understand and prepare a story on Tableau. Upload the script in this repo (please make it readable and with comments), along the Tableau workbook link. Use Tableau for data visualisation.

## Content of MVP

Make sure that you hand in at least:

- a list of one main questions and a couple of sub-questions (can also be added in the .txt file);
- a story with at least two story points;
- brief comments on how to interpret the data (in the story);
- very short conclusion (in the story).

## Deliverables

- `main.txt` file with a link to your Tableau Public workbook.
- `*.ipynb` or `*.sql` file with your code.

## Submission

Upon completion, add your deliverables to git. Then commit git and push your branch to the remote.
